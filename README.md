# Notorious-TIP

Source code for the ESP capabilities.

Heavily based on https://github.com/devyte/nodemcu-platform and https://github.com/marcoschwartz/aREST-ESP8266

With added encrytion and TLS 1.1. This code poll our backend every 5 second when it's connected to WIFI only. With every request it check the certificate if it's the same that it is saved in the ESP itself.
